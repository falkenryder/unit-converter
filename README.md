Metric/Imperial Unit Converter

Solo project from Scrimba; a Metric/Imperial unit converter. Input any numerical values and it will convert that figure into metres/feet, litres/gallon,
and kilograms/pounds.

- Challenge to self: Be able to finish the program with as little lines of code as possible. I'm really keen on JS, so i was happy to be able to do this. I had also learned some extra stuff outside of the scrimba course to aid me in this process. I will improve this, in the future, when i have advanced further in my learning journey.
  - String Interpolation
  - HTML DOM Input Text value Property

- In an attempt to keep the UI clean, I have also managed to do a oninput function for the userinput, set the input box to transparent, and also removed the number spinner in CSS, but I can't seem to get rid of the padding on top of the gradient background. (Fixed! With a margin : 0 line in h1 section. Much thanks to the super helpful scrimba discord!)
