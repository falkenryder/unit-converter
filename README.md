Metric/Imperial Unit Converter

Solo project from Scrimba; a Metric/Imperial unit converter. Input any numerical values and it will convert that figure into metres/feet, litres/gallon,
and kilograms/pounds.

- Managed to do a oninput function for the userinput, so that it looks really clean on the UI, but can't seem to get rid of the padding on top of the gradient background. (Fixed! With a margin : 0 line in h1 section. Much thanks to the super helpful scrimba discord!)
