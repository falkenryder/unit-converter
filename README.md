Metric/Imperial Unit Converter

Solo project from Scrimba; a Metric/Imperial unit converter. Input any numerical values and it will convert that figure into metres/feet, litres/gallon,
and kilograms/pounds.

- Managed to do a oninput function for the userinput, so that it looks really clean on the UI, but can't seem to get rid of the padding on top of the gradient background.
